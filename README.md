About Emotions is an application that uses Object Literals to showcase an emotion and a quote that represents that emotion. When an emotion or an emoji is clicked the the title screen opens a different screen in the Background with the emotion in a element. As you move your mouse over the element it reveals an qoute. There Four emotions and each emotion has 6 different Quotes that represents that emotion. This project was made based on the emotions I come across often when im programming an application. I become Happy when I am programming, sad when I cant figure out a problem, angry when I feel imposter syndrom, and bored when I read a bunch of theroy and im not building. This application has taught me how to work with Objects,Function Decalarations, Positioning, styling and much more. The main thing this application taught me was how to feel when i expereince each emotion and a quote that reaches me mentally.
